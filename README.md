  - Express
  - Firebase Firestore

- **Frontend:**
  - React

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to deepen our understanding of backend development using Node.js and Express. While the frontend, developed with React, exists as part of the application, it was intentionally kept minimal as the primary emphasis was on backend technologies.

## Key Features

- **Backend Implementation:**
  - Utilized Node.js and Express for server-side development.
  - Stored user data, including names, emails, and phone numbers, in Firebase Firestore.

- **Learning Outcome:**
